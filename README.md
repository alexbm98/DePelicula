# DePelicula
Web app where you can watch trailers of films, series and anime, as well as look for related information about them. You've also the possibility of sign up
the website, which grants you access to the trailers.

## Films page
The films page is the main page of the app. Here you can find all the available films, and you can also search for a specific film.

On the other hand, we've the anime page, where you can find differents animes (there will be more in the future) with the same information as in the case of 
the films.

## Administrator account and options
As I said before, you can sign in the web application, but there is one account with administrator role, which has privileged access to some options that 
other accounts don't have, like adding new films, deleting existing ones, or updating information about any existing film.

And here is the modal that let you deleting a film.
